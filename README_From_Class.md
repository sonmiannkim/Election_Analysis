## Challenge Overview
There were minor problems mapping path variables using Python and Visual Studio Code which were resolved by reinstalling it, however python provided functions ran fast with fewer code and I was able to get the result quick.

## Challenge Summary
It was a great experience to learn python file system (read/write) so quick.
